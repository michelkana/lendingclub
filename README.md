# lendingclub - Loan charge-off prediction and investment strategy analysis

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks of my final team project at Harvard Extension School in Fall 2018 on predicting fully paid and charged off loans with fairness in selection for the course CS109A:Introduction to Data Science. We used the publicly available lending club data set to work on data driven predictive modeling of loans that powers a strategy designed that considers algorithm fairness.
